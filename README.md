To install:

- copy the greenhouse folder into your appropriate localhost path
    - you may need to edit "wp-config.php" to match your MySQL DataBase user permission and Database name

- import both of the databases (create them first in your local host if you are importing for the first time)
    - WP DB holds WordPress's information
    - greenhouse-data DB holds information or statistics about the greenhouse (change mySqlConnection inside PHP folder to match your imported database)

Note: you may need to run a find/replace query on WP DB to change the permalinks
